# Efficient Large-Scale Data Processing with Pandas

## Overview
This project provides an optimized solution for handling large-scale CSV files efficiently using Python and pandas. By leveraging chunk-based reading, it ensures minimal memory usage while processing massive datasets.

## Features
- **Chunk-based Reading**: Reads large CSV files in chunks to prevent memory overload.
- **Efficient Data Processing**: Enables iterative processing for large datasets.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for analyzing datasets that exceed available system memory.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **CSV Processing**

## Installation
To use this project, ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python process_large_csv.py
   ```

## Example Code
```python
import pandas as pd

file_path = "large_dataset.csv"
chunk_size = 100000

chunks = pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=chunk_size)
for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk.head())
```
